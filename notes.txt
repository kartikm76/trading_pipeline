Next Steps for Implementation
Update ConfigManager: Ensure your Python configuration parser is updated to read these nested scaling blocks based on the active environment.

Centralize Enrichment: Now that the paths are set, the orchestrate function should be modified to read from the landing path, perform the option_type and trade_date extractions, and write to the silver_table_name defined in the common props.

Local Test: Run one single file through the dev config. If the extraction logic correctly populates the Silver table with trade_date and mid_price, we can then trigger the 10-file batch loop.
