## Capture Codebase Snapshot
1. Capture specific root files
for f in 0_batch_pipeline.sh 1_strategy_run.sh config.yaml Dockerfile README.md requirements.txt; do
    [ -f "$f" ] && echo "--- FILE: ./$f ---" && cat "$f"
done > codebase_snapshot.txt

2. Append all .py and .sh files from infrastructure and src
find ./infrastructure ./src -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.sh" \) \
-exec echo "--- FILE: {} ---" \; -exec cat {} \; >> codebase_snapshot.txt

## Start Colima with Rosetta
colima start --arch aarch64 --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta
docker buildx build   --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64   -t 949934295366.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/trading-pipeline:latest   --push .

## Potential Next Steps:
1. Fix the --strategies bug + IronCondorStrategy issues
There are two code bugs worth addressing:
a) StrategyFactory.get_strategy() only searches active_strategy_info (line 14 of strategy_factory.py), which filters for active: "Y". So even though strategy_orchestrator.py bypasses the active check when --strategies is passed, the factory will throw "No strategy found for class IronCondorStrategy" because it's active: "N". The override is broken.
b) IronCondorStrategy has bugs:
__init__ takes config but not underlying, yet references self.underlying (line 8) — will crash with NameError
required_columns references expiration and strike but Silver table uses expiry_date and strike_price
Missing logic() abstract method implementation
Missing cast_decimals() call in _process_partition

2. deploy_and_submit performance optimization
The current implementation of deploy_and_submit.sh can be optimized for better performance.
Consider parallelizing the upload and submission steps to reduce overall execution time.

3. Run AWS regression of dataload and strategy
4. Add a new strategy and test it locally and AWS
